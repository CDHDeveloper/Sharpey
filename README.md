Sharpey
=======

Playing around with creation of my own language and nodejs based transpiler. 
Language is starting out as a variant of C#, hence Sharpey.

The code uses [jison] (https://github.com/zaach/jison) a Bison/Yacc variant in JS to create the parser code that is based off the specification in the .jison file. 

To run jison you'll need to do "npm install jison -g" to install jison using npm, the node package manager.
